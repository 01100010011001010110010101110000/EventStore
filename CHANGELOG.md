### Added
- Supports for pull request linting and automatic changelog update [EventStore#2391](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/pull/2391)
- The following options have been added `AuthorizationType` and `AuthorizationConfig` to mirror that of the existing `AuthenticationType` and `AuthenticationConfig`. [EventStore#2385](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/pull/2385)
- A mandatory configuration parameter named: `TrustedRootCertificatesPath`. The certificate store will be expanded with the root certificates in this path before certificate validation. For server certificate validation, trust is restricted to system certificates + the specified root certificates but for client certificate validation, trust is restricted only to the specified root certificates. Before this change, all root certificates installed on the system were trusted. [EventStore#2335](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/pull/2335)
- Client certificate validation to the internal HTTP interface which is used for gossip/elections [EventStore#2335](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/pull/2335)

### - Use TrySetResult instead of SetResult so that exceptions are not thrown if setting result twice [EventStore#2406](https
- //github.com/EventStore/EventStore/pull/2406)

### Fixed
- Connect to existing master when a node starts up instead of triggering unnecessary elections if a quorum of nodes is already present. [EventStore#2386](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore/pull/2386)
